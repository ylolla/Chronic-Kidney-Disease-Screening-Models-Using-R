# Chronic Kidney Disease Screening Models Using R


Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function over time, which is associated with high risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and other complications. CKD in primary care is largely asymptomatic and the pathological condition in which CKD is developed is often unknown. Studies have shown that diabetes and hypertension are the two main causes of CKD which are responsible for up to two third of its causes. Strategies for early identification and treatment of individuals with chronic kidney disease can help prevent the progression of kidney disease to the end stage of kidney failure.

The current analysis also provides shortcomings of the analytical techniques used to produce the predicted outcomes to open up possibilities for improvement in CKD detection in the future. 

We analyzed demographic and health information data collected from 1999 to 2000 and 2001 to 2002 consisting of 6000 individuals who have been reported with and without CKD to identify clinical or sociodemographic factors which largely contribute to detecting individuals with CKD. We combined the evidence from the existing literature with our data analysis and conclude that age, hypertension, diabetes, weight, body mass index (BMI), and history of cardiovascular disease are the major factors that increase the risk of CKD. In addition, high risk group includes those who are female and who have family history of CKD.
